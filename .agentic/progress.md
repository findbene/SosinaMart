# SosinaMart — Implementation Progress

## Session: 2026-02-06 — Fix Kidist AI Chat & Voice

### Context
User reported that Kidist (AI shopping concierge) was completely broken — returning only the error message "I apologize, but I encountered an issue. Please try again or contact the store directly at 470-359-7924." for every chat message. Voice chat button was also non-functional.

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Diagnose root cause of chat failure
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Finding:** `.env.local` was missing all Gemini API keys (`GEMINI_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- **Finding:** `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` was also missing, causing middleware auth errors
- **Commit:** (env file changes — not committed, gitignored)

#### 2. Fix Gemini model quota exhaustion
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Finding:** `gemini-2.0-flash` free tier quota was at zero (limit: 0)
- **Fix:** Switched text chat to `gemini-2.5-flash` (newer, has quota)
- **Verified:** All 4 languages working (English, Amharic, Tigrigna, Spanish)
- **Commit:** `a53100d`

#### 3. Fix voice chat model
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Finding:** `gemini-2.0-flash-live-001` no longer available in model list
- **Fix:** Switched to `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-latest` (supports bidiGenerateContent)
- **Verified:** WebSocket live connection tested — connects and receives setupComplete
- **Commit:** `cdff108`

#### 4. Upgrade @google/genai SDK
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Finding:** SDK was at 0.7.0, latest is 1.40.0 — massive gap
- **Fix:** Updated to 1.40.0, removed deprecated `FunctionDeclaration` import
- **Verified:** Text chat still works, no compilation errors
- **Commit:** `bdbada4`

#### 5. Fix voice audio overlap and mic feedback
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Finding 1:** Every audio chunk created a new AudioContext and played immediately — chunks overlapped
- **Finding 2:** Mic processor was connected to `inputCtx.destination` — fed mic audio back through speakers
- **Finding 3:** Int16 conversion had no clamping — potential distortion
- **Fix:** Single shared AudioContext, sequential audio queue, zero-gain silent sink for mic processor
- **Commit:** `57489ce`

#### 6. Fix choppy/breaking audio playback
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Finding:** Sequential queue via onended callbacks still had micro-gaps between chunks
- **Fix:** Gapless scheduled playback using `AudioContext.currentTime` — chunks pre-scheduled to start exactly when previous ends
- **Also:** Using SDK's `msg.data` getter instead of deep property traversal; filtering out `thought` parts
- **Commit:** `bbc65b4`

#### 7. Voice audio quality confirmed
- **Status:** COMPLETED — user confirmed "voice has been fixed and it sounds great"

## Session: 2026-02-06 — Voice Languages, Interruption, Prices, Logging

### Context
User confirmed voice quality is fixed but reported: (1) only English works for voice — Tigrigna, Amharic, Spanish not responding in the correct language, (2) Kidist won't stop talking when user tries to interrupt — queues user input instead, (3) response delay, (4) wants prices removed from all products, (5) wants a comprehensive logging system.

### Completed Tasks

#### 8. Fix multilingual voice chat
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Root cause 1:** `connectVoice()` didn't accept or pass any language parameter
- **Root cause 2:** Setting `languageCode: 'am-ET'` or `'ti-ET'` in speechConfig caused the model to produce **zero output** — the BCP-47 codes for Amharic/Tigrigna are not supported by the native audio model
- **Fix:** Added `language` param to `connectVoice()` with CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT in system prompt. Only set BCP-47 `languageCode` for supported languages (en-US, es-US). Amharic/Tigrigna rely on system prompt instruction alone.
- **Tested:** All 4 languages produce audio — EN:161, AM:143, TI:86, ES:137 chunks
- **Commits:** `ed1feed`, `1971e58`

#### 9. Fix voice interruption (barge-in)
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Root cause:** `onmessage` handler had no interruption detection. Audio chunks were pre-scheduled via `AudioContext.currentTime` — even when the server stopped generating (user interrupts), already-buffered chunks kept playing to completion
- **Fix:** Added `activeSourcesRef` to track all `AudioBufferSourceNode`s. Added `cancelAudio()` function that stops all active sources and resets the playback timeline. `onmessage` now checks `msg.serverContent?.interrupted` — when detected, calls `cancelAudio()` immediately. `stopVoiceSession()` also calls `cancelAudio()` before closing.

#### 10. Reduce voice response delay
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Fix:** Reduced ScriptProcessor buffer from 4096 to 2048 samples at 16kHz — cuts mic-to-wire latency from 256ms to 128ms per chunk

#### 11. Remove prices from all products
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Files modified:**
  - `ProductCard.tsx` — removed `formatPrice(product.price)` display and unused import
  - `CartSidebar.tsx` — removed individual item prices and cart total
  - `CheckoutModal.tsx` — removed per-item prices and total, replaced with item count
- **Kept intact:** Product images, names, descriptions, category badges, Add to Cart buttons

#### 12. Add comprehensive logging system
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **New files:**
  - `src/lib/logger.ts` — server-side logger: JSON lines format, daily rotating files in `logs/`, levels (ERROR/WARN/INFO/DEBUG), categories (frontend/backend/database/api/security/cart/crm/ai/auth/middleware/general)
  - `src/lib/client-logger.ts` — client-side logger: fire-and-forget POST to `/api/log`, same category/level API
  - `src/app/api/log/route.ts` — API endpoint receives client logs and writes via server logger
- **Integrated into:** `src/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts` (AI errors, DB errors, API request logging)
- **`.gitignore`** — added `/logs/`

### Key Decisions
- Used same API key for both `GEMINI_API_KEY` (server) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` (client)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix exposes key to browser — required for client-side voice WebSocket
- Voice model uses `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-latest` — audio output is PCM at 24kHz

### Environment Variables Required (Vercel Dashboard)
| Variable | Value | Set? |
|----------|-------|------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | AIzaSyCr...emZc | User needs to confirm |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` | AIzaSyCr...emZc | User needs to confirm |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | (any random 32+ char string) | User needs to confirm |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | https://sosina-mart.vercel.app | User needs to confirm |

### Files Modified (Session 1)

- `src/components/ai/ChatWidget.tsx` — complete voice audio pipeline rewrite
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` — SDK upgrade 0.7.0 → 1.40.0

### Files Modified (Session 2)

- `src/components/ai/ChatWidget.tsx` — interruption handling, cancelAudio(), activeSourcesRef, reduced buffer, language pass-through
- `src/components/products/ProductCard.tsx` — removed price display

## Session: 2026-02-06 — Major App Improvements (Parallel Agents)

### Context
User requested 5 parallel improvements. 3 background agents were launched. All 3 completed their analysis but NONE could write files (permissions auto-denied for background agents). Each agent produced comprehensive plans/code but zero files were actually modified.

### Not Implemented (Clarified)

#### Item 4. Plugin marketplace / code-simplifier
- **Status:** N/A — Claude Code has no plugin marketplace or `/plugin` command. This feature doesn't exist.

#### Item 5. LLM Council skill
- **Status:** N/A — No `llm-council` skill exists in the user's skill collection. Would need OpenRouter API keys and custom implementation. Deferred to a future session.
